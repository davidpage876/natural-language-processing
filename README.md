# Natural Language Processing Web App

This is a web application which allows the user to analyse text on other websites using Natural Language Processing (NLP), identifying positive, negative and neutral polarity and sentiment. It was created as part of my Front End Web Development studies through Udacity and RMIT (2021).

## Installation

The app requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 14.x or greater.

Install NPM dependencies with the following command:

    npm -i

Then perform a production build with the following:

    npm run build-prod

## Usage

Start the server with the following command:

    npm run start

The server runs on port 8080, so to view the client open the following url in your browser:

    http://localhost:8080

Using the input fields provided enter the url of the web page you wish to analyse with NLP. The results are displayed upon successful submission.
